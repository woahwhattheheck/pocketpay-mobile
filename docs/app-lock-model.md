# App Lock Model Design Note

> ⚠️ **Status Note:** This document specifies the target design and architectural model for future App Lock mechanisms in PocketPay Mobile. It outlines design goals, lock triggers, biometric/PIN unlock strategies, security boundaries, and failed attempt policies. It does **not** imply that all advanced features (such as hardware-enforced biometric key wrapping or custom PIN vaults) are fully implemented in current production releases.

## 1. Overview & Threat Model

PocketPay Mobile is a non-custodial Stellar wallet. The App Lock model provides a UX-level and cryptographic security barrier designed to protect wallet balances, sensitive personal contacts, and private keys from unauthorized physical access or local session hijacking.

### Threat Model Objectives
- **Local Access Control**: Prevent unauthorized individuals who gain physical access to an unlocked device from opening the wallet app or executing transfers.
- **In-Memory Protection**: Ensure sensitive key material is cleared from transient state when the app is locked or backgrounded.
- **Defense in Depth**: Combine device-level biometric/passcode hardware features with secure storage assumptions for non-custodial protection.

## 2. Lock Triggers & Session Assumptions

App locking operates on a session state machine governed by application lifecycle events and background state transitions.

```
       +--------------------+
       |   Cold Start /     |
       |  App Launch        |
       +---------+----------+
                 |
                 v
       +--------------------+
       |  App Lock Screen   | <----+
       |  (Unauthenticated) |      | Background / Timeout / Manual Lock
       +---------+----------+      |
                 |                 |
     Successful  | Unlock          |
     Auth        v                 |
       +--------------------+      |
       | Active Wallet      +------+
       | Session            |
       +--------------------+
```

### Lock Triggers
1. **Cold Launch**: Every fresh application start forces the lock screen if App Lock is enabled in settings.
2. **Backgrounding & Inactivity**:
   - Switching away from PocketPay to another app immediately sets the session state to `inactive`.
   - After a configurable background grace period (e.g., 30 seconds to 5 minutes), the session status transitions to `unauthenticated`.
3. **Manual Lock**: Users can tap a "Lock Wallet" action in Settings or the top navigation bar to lock the app instantly.
4. **Sensitive Actions Friction**: High-friction operations (such as revealing secret keys, exporting backups, or confirming large transfers) can re-trigger an authentication prompt even within an active session.

### Session Assumptions
- Active session state is maintained strictly in volatile RAM state (`appLockStore`).
- Locking the session immediately wipes decrypted secret keys or cached PIN credentials from memory.
- Session tokens are non-persistent; restarting the app invalidates all active session flags.

## 3. Unlock Methods: Biometrics & PIN

PocketPay supports dual-layer unlock options to accommodate varying device hardware capabilities and user security preferences.

### A. Biometric Authentication (Primary)
- **SDK**: Utilizes `expo-local-authentication`.
- **Supported Hardware**: iOS Face ID / Touch ID, Android Fingerprint / Biometric Prompt / Face Unlock.
- **Fallbacks**: When biometric hardware is unavailable or enrollment changes, the prompt seamlessly falls back to OS-level device passcode verification.

### B. Custom App PIN (Secondary / Standalone)
- **Concept**: A 4-digit to 6-digit numeric PIN created specifically within PocketPay.
- **Storage**: App PINs are never stored in plaintext. They are stored in `expo-secure-store` using PBKDF2 or SHA-256 with a unique per-device salt:
  $$\text{StoredHash} = \text{PBKDF2}(\text{Pin}, \text{Salt}, \text{iterations}=100,000)$$
- **Use Case**: Preferred by users who want a wallet-specific passcode separate from their device unlock PIN.

## 4. Failed Attempt Handling & Rate Limiting

To prevent brute-force attacks against the App PIN or biometric bypass attempts, the system enforces a strict lockout policy.

### Rate-Limiting Policy Matrix

| Failed Attempts | Consequence / Action | Delay Duration |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1 – 2** | Display error message; shake input field | None |
| **3** | Temporary lock; disable input | 30 seconds |
| **5** | Enforced cooldown period | 5 minutes |
| **10** | OS hardware lockout triggered / Fail-safe options shown | 15+ minutes (OS-enforced) |

### Fail-Safe & Emergency Recovery
- **OS Lockout**: Biometric failures beyond device thresholds delegate lockout enforcement to iOS Keychain / Android Keystore.
- **Wallet Reset Option**: If a user forgets their custom App PIN, PocketPay allows resetting local app data.
  > ⚠️ **Reset Caution**: Resetting local storage wipes the saved secret key. The user must re-import their wallet using their offline secret key backup.

## 5. Secure Storage & Cryptographic Assumptions

App Lock interacts with the platform storage layers to protect key material at rest and in memory:

1. **Keychain / Keystore Isolation**:
   - Wallet secret keys reside in `expo-secure-store` (`pocketpay_wallet_secret`).
   - On supported platforms, access flags can require `WHEN_UNLOCKED_THIS_DEVICE_ONLY`.
2. **RAM Hygiene**:
   - Secret key strings read during transaction signing are scoped within function calls and zeroed out upon function completion.
3. **Screen Overlay & Recents Privacy**:
   - On iOS and Android, app switcher preview cards should obscure sensitive balances and key views with a blurred overlay when backgrounded.

---

## 6. Implementation Boundaries & System Risks

| Boundary | Description & Mitigations |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Screen Lock vs Cryptographic Lock** | An app lock screen prevents UI interaction. However, unless secret keys are hardware-bound and require biometric authorization per signing, a compromised or rooted OS could bypass UI-only locks. |
| **Rooted / Jailbroken Devices** | Devices with compromised OS integrity bypass platform Keystore protections. App Lock cannot guarantee security on jailbroken environments. |
| **Backup Requirement** | App Lock is a convenience barrier. The offline paper backup of the Stellar Secret Key (`S...`) remains the ultimate authority for account ownership and recovery. |

## 7. Summary & Future Roadmap

Future iterations of PocketPay will continue to refine the App Lock model by:
- Adding configurable auto-lock timers (Immediate, 1 min, 5 min, 15 min).
- Exploring hardware-bound biometric key release for high-value transaction signing.
- Enhancing background blur previews in the multi-tasker view.

## 8. Actual hydration and failure-state contract (#398)

The current shipped app-lock wiring uses `src/store/appLockStore.ts` and
`src/components/LockScreen.tsx`. This is **not** a guarantee of a hardware-bound
cryptographic vault, custom app PIN, PIN lockout timer or reliable JavaScript
string zeroization. Sections 3–5 above describe intended future controls and
must not be construed as confirmation that they have shipped.

* `isInitialized=false` means **lock policy unknown**. With an existing wallet,
  the root lock boundary renders a neutral loading view and **never** renders
  balances, wallet tabs or signing controls during this state.
* A stored `true` lock value requires authentication on cold rehydration.
  A biometric capability check failure must not flip it to `false`, even if
  hardware availability is temporarily untestable.
* If AsyncStorage cannot read the lock preference, or returns an invalid
  value, the state stays unauthenticated and uninitialized; only a safe
  "Retry Lock Settings" action is shown. The failure cannot bypass the
  gate, and no storage exception details appear on screen.
* A stored `false` or missing value permits normal unlocked experience
  **only after** a successful read. This preserves first-run onboarding
  and the explicit user preference to disable App Lock.
* Platform authentication is still used; do not promise a custom PIN,
  guaranteed OS fallback or resistance to a compromised operating system.

Focused state regressions are in `__tests__/appLockInitialization.test.ts`.
No wallet reset, cloud sync, key-export, custom PIN or new biometric vault
mechanism is introduced by this change.
