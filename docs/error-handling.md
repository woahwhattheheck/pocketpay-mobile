# Global Error Handling

This document describes how PocketPay Mobile catches unexpected failures, shows a safe fallback UI, recovers without exposing secrets, and feeds non-sensitive context into Diagnostics.

---

## Goals

1. **Never leave the user on a broken screen** after a render-time crash.
2. **Offer recovery actions** (retry, go home, restart, share diagnostics).
3. **Hide sensitive material** (secret keys, public keys, mnemonics) from production UI and from logs/exports.
4. **Keep developer logs useful** via a single redacted reporting funnel.
5. **Integrate with Diagnostics** so support can inspect the last failure without seeing wallet secrets.

---

## Architecture

```
App startup (app/_layout.tsx)
  └─ installGlobalErrorHandlers()     // JS exceptions + unhandled rejections
  └─ <ErrorBoundary>                  // Render / lifecycle failures
       └─ <RootContent /> … screens
```

| Layer | File(s) | Catches | User-visible effect |
|-------|---------|---------|---------------------|
| React Error Boundary | `src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx`, `ErrorBoundaryFallback.tsx` | Render, lifecycle, constructors below the boundary | Full-screen fallback with recovery CTAs |
| Global JS handler | `src/utils/globalErrorHandler.ts` | Fatal / non-fatal JS exceptions via `ErrorUtils` | Reports then defers to RN default (RedBox / crash) |
| Promise rejections | same | Unhandled promise rejections | Reports only (does not swallow) |
| Reporting funnel | `src/utils/errorReporting.ts` | All of the above | Redacted `console.error` + in-memory last report |
| Redaction | `src/utils/redactSensitive.ts` | Strings / objects before log or export | Secrets → `[REDACTED_*]` tokens |
| Diagnostics | `src/utils/diagnostics.ts`, `app/diagnostics.tsx` | N/A (read-only) | Redacted JSON + last reported failure |

React error boundaries **do not** catch event-handler or async errors. That is why `installGlobalErrorHandlers()` must run as early as possible in `_layout.tsx` (before the root tree can throw).

---

## Fallback UI & Recovery Actions

`ErrorBoundaryFallback` is the default UI when the root boundary catches an error. Production users see a calm message and **no** stack traces. Development builds can expand redacted debug details.

| Action | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| **Try Again** | Clears boundary state and re-renders children |
| **Go to Home** | Clears boundary state, then `router.replace('/(tabs)')` |
| **Restart App** | Clears boundary state, then best-effort `DevSettings.reload()` |
| **Share Diagnostics** | Opens the OS share sheet with `getDiagnostics()` JSON (already redacted) |

Custom fallbacks remain supported via the `fallback` prop on `ErrorBoundary` (node or render function).

---

## Sensitive Data Boundaries

| Surface | Production | Development |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| Fallback copy | Friendly message only | Same + optional redacted stack |
| `console.error` via `reportError` | Redacted message + context | Same (always redacted) |
| Diagnostics export | Counters / flags / redacted last error | Same + “Trigger Test Error” |
| SecureStore / secret key | Never read by error UI | Never read by error UI |

Redaction covers Stellar `S…` secrets, `G…` public keys, muxed `M…` accounts, BIP39-like phrases, and 64-char hex seeds. Object keys named like `secretKey` / `mnemonic` are replaced wholesale.

---

## Diagnostics Integration

1. Every `reportError` call stores a **redacted** `LastErrorReport` in memory (`getLastErrorReport()`).
2. `getDiagnostics()` includes that snapshot under `lastReportedError`.
3. Settings → About → **Diagnostics** shows the snapshot and can export it.
4. In `__DEV__`, Diagnostics includes **Trigger Test Error** to exercise the boundary (see `docs/release-testing-checklist.md` §5.3).

See also [Development Diagnostics Export](./diagnostics.md).

---

## What This Does *Not* Cover

- Expected domain errors (network failures, insufficient balance, SecureStore restore failures) — those use dedicated UI (banners, wallet restore screen, etc.).
- Shipping a third-party crash reporter — `reportError` has a production hook stub for Sentry/Bugsnag; wire it there when ready.
- Guaranteeing `DevSettings.reload()` in all production builds — Restart is best-effort; Try Again / Go to Home remain the primary recovery paths.

## Onboarding Recovery States

Wallet onboarding (create/import) has its own recovery model defined in `src/types/onboarding.ts`. This covers failures that occur *during* setup, before the user has a wallet.

### State Model

| Variant | When shown | CTA(s) |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| `empty` | New user, no wallet | Create, Import |
| `missing` | Wallet cleared mid-session | Create, Import |
| `loading` | Boot-time SecureStore read | None (spinner) |
| `failed_creation` | Keypair generation or save failed | Try Again, Start Over |
| `failed_import` | Secret key validation or save failed | Try Import Again, Create New |
| `storage_error` | SecureStore/keystore error during save | Retry, Start Over |
| `cancelled` | User navigated back during setup | Create, Import |

### Error Classification

Raw error messages are classified into typed errors via helper functions:

- `classifyOnboardingError(message)` → `OnboardingError` (keypair_generation_failed, invalid_secret_key, etc.)
- `classifyStorageError(message)` → `StorageError` (persist_failed, device_locked, etc.)
- `mapWalletErrorToStorageError(constant)` → `StorageError` (maps walletStorageErrors constants)

Each typed error maps to user-friendly `title`, `message`, and `guidance` strings via `ONBOARDING_ERROR_MESSAGES` and `STORAGE_ERROR_MESSAGES`.

### Recovery Flow

```
User taps Create/Import
  ├─ Success → WalletEmptyState "success" → Go to Wallet
  ├─ Onboarding error → WalletEmptyState "failed_creation"/"failed_import"
  │     ├─ Try Again → resets error, retries operation
  │     └─ Start Over → resets to initial empty state
  └─ Storage error → WalletEmptyState "storage_error"
        ├─ Retry → resets error, retries operation
        └─ Start Over → resets to initial empty state
```

Cancelled setup (user presses Back during create/import flow) leaves the user on the `(auth)` index screen with no wallet state changes — the safe default state.

### Import validation, recovery, and overwrite protection (#521)

The import screen validates blank input, the secret-key prefix, exact length, base32 characters, and the Stellar checksum before invoking the SDK. Invalid input returns fixed, user-readable copy rather than echoing the entered secret. An SDK import failure is classified to a typed onboarding error; neither the exception's raw message nor the secret seed is rendered in the error-state UI.

On a successful SDK import, the screen checks the **current** wallet store immediately before attempting SecureStore persistence:

| Existing wallet | Attempted import | Result |
|-----------------|------------------|--------|
| None | Valid seed | Continue with secure persistence |
| Same public key | Valid seed | `duplicate_wallet`: reject; original wallet is retained |
| Different public key | Valid seed | `existing_wallet`: reject; an implicit replacement is not allowed |

The two new errors use fixed safe messages from `ONBOARDING_ERROR_MESSAGES`, point the user to a backup and explicit reset before replacement, and never display the public account key or entered secret. The root app waits for initial SecureStore restoration before showing the import screen, and the import screen keeps only one import/save in flight. On a successful save, the secret is cleared from the form state.

If `setWallet()` reports a failed secure save, the import screen uses the existing typed `storage_error` state (not success), with retry/start-over actions and safe guidance. The explicit Cancel Import action remains disabled while the persistence request is in flight because the secure-store write cannot be cancelled or rolled back by the screen.

The focused `src/types/onboarding.import.test.ts` cases cover the empty, same-account, and different-account decisions and confirm the new error strings remain fixed rather than reflecting secret input. They do **not** replace device-level keystore, biometric, accessibility, or full navigation verification.

## Contributor Checklist

- [ ] Unexpected render failures are left to the root boundary (do not swallow with empty `catch` that leaves a blank screen).
- [ ] New logging of errors goes through `reportError` (or at least `redactSensitiveString` / `sanitizeError`).
- [ ] Production UI never shows raw `error.stack` or secret-bearing messages.
- [ ] Tests cover fallback visibility, recovery reset, and redaction when you change this area (`__tests__/ErrorBoundary.test.tsx`, `__tests__/globalErrorHandler.test.tsx`, `src/utils/__tests__/redactSensitive.test.ts`).

## Transaction Deep Link Error States

When a user arrives at the transaction detail screen via deep link (`stellar-pocketpay:///transaction/{id}`), the screen handles several error states beyond the standard in-memory lookup.

### State Model

| State | When shown | User-facing UI | Actions |
|-------|-----------|----------------|---------|
| `invalid` | ID fails validation (empty, too long, control chars) | "Invalid Transaction Link" + error reason | Go Back |
| `loading` | ID valid but not in store; network fetch in progress | Spinner + "Loading transaction…" | None (auto) |
| `not_found` | ID valid but operation not found on Horizon | "Transaction Not Found" + explanation | Try Again, Go Back |
| `error` | Network failure during fetch | "Connection Error" + guidance | Retry, Go Back |
| `loaded` | Transaction found (in store or via network) | Full transaction detail UI | All existing actions |

### Validation Rules

Transaction IDs are validated by `validateTransactionId()` in `src/utils/validation.ts`:
- Must be non-empty after trimming
- Maximum 128 characters
- No control characters (`\x00-\x1f`, `\x7f`)

### Network Fetch

`fetchOperationById()` in `src/services/stellar.ts` calls `server.operations().operation(id).call()`. Returns `null` on 404 (not found) and throws on other errors. The transaction detail screen shows appropriate UI for each case.

### Auth Gate Deep Link Preservation

The root layout (`app/_layout.tsx`) preserves deep link URLs when a logged-out user arrives. The URL is stored in a `useRef` and replayed via `Linking.openURL()` after authentication completes. This ensures deep links from notifications, receipts, or external sources work end-to-end.
