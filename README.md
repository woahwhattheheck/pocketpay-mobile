# Stellar PocketPay

React Native Expo wallet for Stellar Testnet. The app aims to feel polished and usable for core wallet flows while still evolving as the PocketPay ecosystem matures.

## Project Status

- This project is best described as a polished but still-evolving wallet experience rather than a production-ready product.
- Core flows such as wallet creation and import, balance checks, sending and receiving, contacts, and the vault UI are implemented and actively refined.
- The app is intentionally focused on Stellar Testnet for development and experimentation. Testnet XLM has no real monetary value.
- The vault uses explicit **planned, disabled, unavailable, and ready** states. Without a configured contract it is a non-interactive placeholder. "Ready" means configuration prerequisites are satisfied, not that deployment or transaction success has been verified. Time locks remain local previews; see [Vault Readiness](./docs/vault-readiness.md).

## Features

- Wallet creation and import
- XLM balance and transactions
- Send and receive with QR codes
- Address book contacts
- Soroban Savings Vault (explicit readiness states; placeholder actions disabled until configured)

For the expected screen sequence, validation, and UI states behind these features, see [Main wallet user flows](docs/user-flows.md).

## Screenshots

> 📸 Screenshots below are placeholders. To update them, capture each screen from a simulator or device (use dummy/funded Testnet data only — never real keys or mainnet funds) and replace the files in `docs/screenshots/`.

### Updating screenshots

1. Run the app in a simulator with a funded Testnet account.
2. Navigate to the relevant screen.
3. Take a screenshot and export it at roughly **390 × 844 px** (iPhone 14 logical resolution) or equivalent Android size.
4. Save it to `docs/screenshots/<screen-name>.png` using the filenames shown above.
5. Commit only the image files — never include screenshots that reveal a real secret key or personal data.
